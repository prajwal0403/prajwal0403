## About Me 
Currently I am a student at Masai School learning Full Stack Web Development.Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated with computers. Although I only used them to play games then,I started my coding journey way back in the 11th standard.While completing my graduation in Hotel Management, I came to know that one can pursue a full-time career in coding; something which had piqued my interest right from my school days. While I did spend some time trying to learn it on my own, it didn't take much convincing that I needed a structured program if I really wanted to make it as a developer. That's how I ended up at Masai School. My journey as a full-stack web development student with Masai School has been great so far, but there is no doubt that I am still in the middle of this journey. The more I learn, the more I realize that the life of a developer is actually a never-ending journey.

I am highly skilled in Javascript, ReactJs, NodeJs, MongoDb, Express, HTML and CSS. In my spare time I like playing video games and watching films.

I hope to work in a dynamic organisation that helps enhance my technical skills and knowledge. I would like to work in an organisation that challenges me on a daily basis and helps me grow and develop alongside the organisation.
